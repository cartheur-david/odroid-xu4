## odroid-xu4 (hardkernel)

Code repository for the XU4 computer that drives the robot and is installed into the head.

### Background

This board was chosen due primarily to the long-term survivability of the XU4. It is no longer manufactured and is an ARMv7 32-bit device, but since it still supports dotnet 9.0, I will keep it working.
